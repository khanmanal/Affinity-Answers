Q2: Which is an interesting data set you discovered recently? Why is it your favorite? No datasets on Kaggle, please.

Ans:
I was working on dataset by the client in my current company that was the sales dataset of an American Coffee company FBC. It was used to predict the future sales of their coffee products based on previous years' sales. It was my favourite because it was a real world sales data, which showed real world numbers and also it conatined the varience that this coffee company faced in sales when Covid hit in last 2 years.
